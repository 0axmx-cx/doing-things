Download the following:
`sudo apt install xscreensaver xscreensaver-gl-extra xscreensaver-data-extra xscreensaver-screensaver-bsod`
- I believe this should give access to all the available screensavers, depending on the version being shipped by the package manager.

Also, typically I tend to write a startup script in order to start the daemon on startup.
I'm sure there is a better way to do this involving systemd services.

I need to look into that in the future and update this document.

In the meantime, I need to include the section of the startup script that would relate to having the daemon start.

`Code Here`
